# Discovery Outcomes Summary

- Component Structure for Alpha - National scalable concerns
- Good UI from previous work
- GP Integration = hard
- Question still to be answered - how can digital improve upon and give more benefit that manual health check - instead of just trying to make a carbon copy of existing process
- Question still to be answered - preloading of data
- Question still to be answered - Data in GP record vs data available to GP - what would GP's want / expect
- Question still to be answered - Invite and cohort management

# DHC Technical Discovery Review

**TODO - Write a summary encompassing all work that has been completed as part of the Technical Discovery**
