# Summary

The Discovery phase (of the Government Agile Framework) focusses on identifying constraints that may impact the delivery of a service.  This report explores the possible technological constraints.

There are 11 key areas that have been identified during Discovery research. It is suggested that these are all taken into consideration during a technical implementation of the NHS Digital Health Check. 

The technical requirements for the core of Digital Health Check are not novel, or overly complex. A well architected technological implementation should not be a blocker for the progression of this programme. 

The challenges that will be faced are likely to be with the integration options with existing providers of required data; providers of required external services, and those that require to be notified of Health Check results.

From the research (of available material) undertaken in discovery, there is no existing platform that currently provides answers to all of the identified areas. If this programme is put to tender, it is advised that any supplier should be able to provide sound technical explanation to how each of these areas are approached.

The next stage of this programme could include an Alpha phase build - expanding on ideas from existing projects, and exploring areas that have not been addressed in previous work.

The scope for this discovery has been to look at how the current NHS Health Check can be transformed into a digital form. However, further questions could be asked to how a digital version of the Health Check can improve (and add additional benefit) to the current process.

### High Level Discovery Outcomes
- Discovered 11 areas suggested for further technical exploration 
- No existing provider has a solution for all areas identified
- User Interface from previous work has reuse potential
- Core "Calculation" available from previous work 
- [GP Integration is not easy]({% link digital-health-check/gp-integration.md%})

### Proposed Targeted Outcomes for an Alpha Phase
- An MVP is not the target for Alpha
- Develop a number possible solutions for each of the areas identified
- After Alpha, a Beta could then take the best solutions in each area from Alpha into an MVP, with iterative development towards production.

# Review of Existing Work

## 01. Digital Health Check Library Code
At its core, a Digital Health Check is:


```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    ObsDataIn[Demographics & Observation Data In]
    RawProcessData{Prepare Data}
    Data[Health Check Data]
    Calculate{Calculate Result}
    Out[Health Check Result Out]
    ObsDataIn -->RawProcessData
    RawProcessData -->Data
    Data -->Calculate
    Calculate -->Out
```

A build alpha could aim to making this available in a open source digital form (whether an API, or  just a code library that can be used in a CLI) ensuring any future work can cleanly and easily build upon this.

The perceived complexities for a Digital health Check come from where the "Data In" will come from, and where the "Data Out" will go.

> Idempotent Library for Calculating DHC results from provided prepared data


## 02. Digital Health Check Tool API 
The development of an API first designed system that is just a simple Tool for returning the results of a full set of Health Check data. This will be stateless and can be used by the Digital Health Check Service, both internally and externally. This is a key concept to allowing the DHC work to be reused, and re worked, in the future.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    In(Data In & Out)
    API(API)
    Process{Process Data}
    In <----> API
    API --> Process
```

> ### Technical considerations for APIs
> - *Easy data model, including for those who are not Health IT Professionals* 
> - *RESTful*
> - *Swagger/OpenAPI "design first"*
> - *Asynchronous, use of Location Header*
> - *Clear metric and performance requirements for all API calls*
> - *OAuth claims scoping*
> - *Semantic Versioning*
> - *End of Life per version*

### Data Modelling
The tooling APIs should accessible and be intuitive for all to use. "I, as a citizen with some technical understanding" should be able to call the Digital Health Check tool API and receive a result.

As such, there must be though given to if a FHIR data model is the best way to go forward for public APIs that are focussed on the Citizen consuming them.

FHIR has a key place in inter health system communication, but it is likely to be perceived as bloated and overly complex for exposing APIs to Citizens.

An outline of [Health Check Data]({% link digital-health-check/architecture/data.md%}) expands this further.

## 03. Health Check State Management

Previous reviewed work has kept state management of the Health Check (W&P also did this) process inside the User Interface. Instead of this approach, an API driven process could be used, alongside Event Sourcing for state management.

The benefit of this approach is that the User Interface becomes nothing but a graphical window to the logic of the process. This allows the whole process to be directly integrated with any other application, present or future – including custom integration if local regions wanted to provide the health check in there own systems or apps, but with full visibility for all inside the central NHS UK, NHS app or other central app.

It will also allow for clear reporting for the exact current state of progress for all health checks.

## 04. Eligibility & Invite Integration

Invite management can be separated into two stages, first the collating who is eligible for a health check (based on age, date of any previous health check, and past medical history). The second stage is then a decision if to send an invite.

Currently this process is performed locally at a GP level. It is suggested that both these processes (for digital and face to face NHS Health Checks) could be moved centrally and automated per local needs.

The first benefit of moving the identification of eligibility and invite centrally are for reporting purposes. There is then one central clear picture of both historical and real time health check status.  The eligibility and invite management could also be used for tracking non digital health checks.

In addition to reporting purposes after "Go Live" - end to end reporting will allow for quantifiable metrics to be defined - allowing a benefits realisation processes to utilise these in helping to determine the successful outcome of the project development. 

Additionally a centralised eligibility and invitation function simplifies:
- The management of any eligibility criteria change
- Handling patients changing GP
- Provides a single source of invitation to meet the digital NHS Health Check eligibility requirements, including embedding eligibility confirmation as part of the process
- Ensures invitation to the digital NHS Health Check are handled consistently

Any invite system should consider the unique needs of local regions, GP federations, GP Surgeries and individual GPs. It is proposed that any solution should include the ability for configuration of invite sending at any of these levels. 

For example, a region may want to default to send by default 10 Health Check invites per GP surgery per week. However, a specific surgery might want to completely pause invites, and another might want to send invites to all those eligible. 

Any management system that requires a health professional to use, should utilise existing identity providers so there is not a requirement of yet another login. It is suggested that CIS2 (with existing usernames and smartcards) is the preferred option.

There are numerous screening services that exist in the NHS (breast, bowel etc), that may have similar requirements for eligibility and invitation management. There is likely learnings that can be found from investigating how these services approach this.

With the Eligibility & Inviting being a separate system to the actual health check - this give rise to the possibilities of non-invited citizens also being able to use the health check, without it being an "official" Health Check (ie data not sent to GP).

> **Area 04 Summary** 
> 
> Platform for managing selection of eligibility and digital invites.


## 05. Authorisation   
With NHS Login for citizens, and CIS2 for health care professional’s (and even nhs.net for wider NHS staff) all supporting OpenId – there is no need for any new platform to need its own Identity. 

With the possibility of this programme requiring both HCP and Citizen login, a single authorisation platform should support both of the NHS OpenID IdPs, with it being used to protect the API resources directly.



> **Area 05 Summary** 
> 
> Platform for allowing logins to the UI component from multiple IdPs (NHS Login and CIS2).


## 06. User Interface
Any digital health check system should be totally platform agnostic. It should work in a web browser or mobile or desktop and also through native apps. This can be supported through an API driven platform.
There are a number of existing user interfaces that follow the pattern that is needed for a Digital Health Check. 

There is the [NHS Wellness and Prevention Alpha](https://wp.nhsei.xyz), which has a fully responsive UI and also the [Southwark DHC UI](https://stagingsouthwarkdhctest.qxlva.io) which follows the standard GDS layout (with asp dotnet core Blazor components).

> ### UI & Integration
> 
> Many NHS digital programme requirements start with statements such as "must integrate with NHS App", or " must integrate with NHS.uk". 
> 
> Requirements such of this can be appreciated, however architectural and development work should think to take this further.
> 
> Focus on digital solutions should not just be on where they envisaged to be used right now. The NHS App in it's current form will not be available for ever; neither will the NHS.UK web site. 
> 
> Digital solutions **MUST** be developed with a clear API first focus, that can then be integrated with the NHS app, or any other app (or web site) that may be specified in the future.


There should also be thought into the customising of the User Interface – if a region wants a varied UI – do they create their own and utilised the central APIs, or does the centrally provided UI allow some level of customisation depending on region? For example, some regions may want to include additional Mental Heath questions.

> **Area 06 Summary** 
> 
> Citizen focused UI for completing health checks.

## 07. Health Care Professional UI
In addition to citizens requiring a UI for completing a Heath check, there is a requirement for HCP to have a UI. This could be used for both ends of the process – both for invite management and also reporting and MI needs.

Again, like the citizen user interface, ideally this would be a wrapper over a fully API driven application, allowing ease of integration with other systems, such as GP specific platforms and Business Intelligence platforms.
 
> **Area 07 Summary** 
> 
> HCP focussed UI for invitation management and reporting of Health Checks.

## 08. Pre-loading Data Service
The lack of a single source of truth for data inside the NHS leads to problems when looking for data to consume. Can data be loaded from a GP? A Local trust PAS? From central Spine? From NHS Account? Should data be gathered from citizens own collected wearables data?

With a focus on GP systems, this itself is not simple. There is a separate review of [GP integration options]({% link digital-health-check/gp-integration.md %}) that goes into more detail.

Pre loading of data from a citizens medical record into a digital health check is not just a technical question, but also a process one. If the technical hurdles are overcome, what data should be loaded? Data from wearables? Data from a blood test last week, or last month? Height and weight?

> **Area 08 Summary** 
> 
> Pre loading of data into health check from existing medical record data.


## 09. Export to GP
Technical solutions for providing health check results not only should address the technical challenges, but also over what control is given GPs over the consumption of the data. If a fully automatic system was in place centrally, there could be cases where some GPs do don’t want all results to be automatically added to a patients record.

As with reading data from GP IT systems, writing results to them is also not simple. There is a separate review of GP integration options [GP integration options]({% link digital-health-check/gp-integration.md %}) that goes into more detail.

The technical challenges of centrally writing directly into GP IT systems, there should be consideration into the difference between providing results to a GP through a separate management system vs directly exporting them – how this could be applied to short, medium and long term plans.

Exporting to GP will pass clinical accountability to primary care upon the completion of the health check, mirroring how accountability is passed to primary care following a face to face NHS Health Check from a Health Check provider. There will be a need to understand the trigger for this. Furthermore, this needs to take into account:

- How to handle incomplete digital NHS Health Checks
- Digital Health Checks containing concerning biometric results requiring immediate intervention.

The introduction of the digital NHS Health Check alongside face to face Health Checks must avoid, where possible, generating new manual tasks, in particular around adding the output of a digital NHS Health Check into the GPIT.

To deliver the value of exporting to GP, all primary care providers will need to ensure their local processes, procedures and systems are adapted to pick up any required referral or work coming from a digital NHS Health Check.

> 
> Supplying GPs with results from Digital Health Checks.



## 10. Blood Test Labs & Appointment Booking Integration
The level of integration available with labs providing testing will vary with the level of customisation required. It may be different regions require different labs, and some may use centrally pooled resources. 

The on going management of this also needs to be considered, should regions be able to dynamically change the lab in use? There is also a question of if the service could be opened to people outside of the standard age range, and give the option of payment for ordering a test at home lab kit.

There needs to be identified a pool of labs that would likely be used, and then further investigation into the integration that is available, both for ordering of kits and getting results.

Citizens may also not want to test at home, and want to book an appointment (with GP/pharmacy/3rd party) for completing the tests face to face. Integration would required with these booking systems.

If the Health Check tooling is opened to "non-eligible" citizens, could there be the possibility of citizen's paying for there own test at home kits on an ad hoc basis. If so, this payment option would need to be also integrated.

> 
> Ordering of test at home kits and collecting of status and results.



## 11. Output Guidance & Local Customization
Once a health check is completed, there is a requirement to provide next step guidance. Thought should be given to how localised this guidance needs to be. Should a GP be able to have the ability to signpost those at their surgery that have a high blood pressure to a local clinic or service?

This possible requirement could lead to a "Multi-tenant" style solution, where different areas and regions appear to be independently managed, but are run on the same underlying platform.

There may also be a requirement for booking into these services, directly from the Health Check Results (similar to booking appointments for face to face testing of bloods).

# Conclusion

This report has identified key areas to aid in the planning of the technical implementation for a Digital NHS Health Check. If the chosen way forward considers each of these areas, it can then be developed in an iterative and incremental way; helping to future proof itself for change by having extensibility and interoperability at the core of its processes.

Integration with existing NHS systems (and wider health provider platforms) is not as easy as it should/could be. This programme could consider not just what is required (and available) now but what could be required (and made available) into the future.

There has been extensive work in previous central programmes (as well as local and commercial offerings) that align with the core aims of the NHS Digital Health Check. Building upon these can provide NHS Digital Health Checks from a central platform that can be managed and configured locally.

Existing projects do already have answers to some identified technical areas, but scoped for a local region only. The requirement for these is how best to scale this to work at a national level, but keeping localised management of these features. 

For a complete "ideal" end to end Digital Health Check, there are challenges to be overcome (mainly around integration). However, that should not stop the Digital Health Check from being viewed as a viable programme. The areas identified can be approached in an Agile way, with both iterative and incremental advances always aiming to deliver benefit. With clear architecture for an extensible solution, a technical solution can be in place to allow the core components of Digital Health Check to be built upon as integration options allow.

Each of the areas identified can be thought of as a Feature (in an Agile Framework). With a benefit hypothesis process undertaken for each of these, the proposed measurable benefit to the citizen and the organisation can be discovered. This can then shape the next phases, through prioritisation and feature estimation.

Initial requirements for "digitising" a non digital project often start with a desire to duplicate the existing process, with a belief this will be the easiest option. It is often quite the opposite, and consideration should be given to how digital can shape and refine an existing process. This often brings benefit to both the end user and the organization.

For an NHS Digital Health Check, a question that could be asked is *"Now the process is Digital, should the Health Check be open to all? (as opposed to 40+)"*. A benefit to the citizen could be improved health through better prevention from more frequent self testing. This would also lead to more data being collected centrally about individuals on a more frequent basis. This can then lead to benefits for the organisation through advanced prevention by not only looking at the situation for a citizen now, but by comparing results easily to previous Health Checks, utilising detection of unique trends for each citizen individually.
