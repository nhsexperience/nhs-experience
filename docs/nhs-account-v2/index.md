# Preface

The NHS, by the very nature of its organisational structure, is an incubator of data silos. What do we mean my nature of its organisation structure? Citizens of the UK (if not the world) hear "The NHS" so often, that few question how it is structured behind the scenes. Who really knows how NHS England or NHS Wales differ nationally? Or really how separate each county handles Trusts? Or in that each county there may be many different Trusts handling different care? That's all before looking at how each GP Surgery may be fully independent to all others around it, with very little in common. However, what they do all have in common, are the letters NHS in front of their name.

Common branding leads to a perception of connectedness. That data flows with ease, of common storage and ubiquitous access to all information. Citizens regularly experience the impact of the perception with almost every interaction they have with "The NHS". They may not know the cause, but they feel the impact.

If a citizen was being treated at Acme Corp Hospital was told they needed to goto Beta Corp Hospital, would they assume that all the data from the hospital in the Acme Corp would be readily available to staff in hospitals that are part of Beta Corp? Probably not. Just in the same way that if they had a bank account with Bank A and also and account with Bank B, they wouldn't expect Bank B to be able to show them statements from Bank A, even though both companies provide banking services.

Keeping with the banking them, a majority of citizens see all NHS hospitals like branches of the same bank. The letters NHS are in big before the hospital name, so they assume connectivity. They see NHS QEQM as a hospital name, not NHS EKHT QEQM.

The NHS has been in existence for so long, that citizens of the UK are deeply in the illusion that it is one sprawling organisation, leading to it being very hard to explain why data recorded at a hospital in Norfolk is not readily available at a hospital or GP surgery in Kent. 

If a patient was treated at a hospital called just Norfolk and Norwich hospital, and then transferred to East Kent University hospital Ashford - would that patient be more sympathetic to the fact that their past data was not there?

There is also the nature of how data is controlled. Citizens rarely understand that GPs control their primary care record - it is "the GPs data", not the Citizens - and ultimately the controllers decide on the sharing capabilities of that data.

We can't change how the NHS has become structure as an organisation, and we can't change the fact that the control of data and where it is stored has ended up as it has. However, we can look at how best to level the playing field, and bring data sharing between citizens and health care professionals into alignment, to allow data to be shared safely, and with consent of both the data controllers and the subject of that data that is being shared.

This paper / investigation / research looks to question not just what data is shared with what people, but how we empower health professionals to ensure data is available for safe sharing, whilst ultimately moving the final control of what data is shared with who and what, into the citizen's own hands.
