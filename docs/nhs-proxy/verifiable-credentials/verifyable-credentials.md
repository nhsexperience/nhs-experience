## A requirement outside of the NHS

For VC's to be truly useful, the current issuer of traditional proofs of identities and relationships (eg Driving licence, birth certificate, court issues) also need to be issuers of Digital Verifiable Credentials.

| Issuer  | Name                    | Summary Type | Claims                                     | Description |

### Other National NHS Organisations?

- NHS Wales?
- NHS Scotland?
- NHS Northern Ireland?

## Cross Department / Office / Agencies Collaboration

- Get involvement with other government offices
- Pan Government working group
- NHS is already doing this for Staff Digital Passports

## Example of VC in use

> ## Citizenship by Parentage
>
> <https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#citizenship-by-parentage>
>
> ### Background
>
> Sam wants to claim US citizenship because his mother is American. Sam has a digital birth certificate from Kenya, where he was born while his Mother was in the Peace corps. He also has a digital version of his mother's US passport. Because his mother’s name changed between his birth and the issuance of the passport, Sam also has a marriage license with her maiden and married names. Sam is applying for a new passport from the US Secretary of State.
>
> ### Distinction
>
> This use case is challenging because the mother’s name changed, by marriage, between the issuance of the birth certificate and passport.
>
> ### Scenario
>
> Sam’s mother emailed him the certificate, license, and passport as independent Verifiable Credentials. He then creates a verifiable presentation which includes those credentials, a statement of their relationship to each other and his relationship to his mother. He then visits the US Secretary of State website, creates an account, starts the application for a passport, and uploads his new verifiable presentation as supporting evidence. After processing the application, Sam is issued both a traditional passport and a new digital passport.
>
> ### Verifiable Credentials
>
> - Birth Certificate: Establishes relationship to mother with maiden name
> - Marriage License: Establishes mother's name change
> - Mother’s Passport: Establishes mother's US citizenship
> - Sam’s Passport: Establishes Sam is the child in the birth certificate
> - Verifiable Presentation: A verifiable presentation which includes those three credentials, adds his name, photo, and demographic data along with the assertions that —
>   - He is the child in the birth certificate.
>   - The mother in the birth certificate, the person in the passport, the spouse in the marriage license are all the same person.
>   - Trust Hierarchy
>   - Sam is legally liable for his claim to the rights of citizenship. The state department is on the hook for verifying the underlying credentials and Sam’s claims, including correlating against any additional data they might already have.
>
> ### Threat model
>
> - Threat: Terrorist / Identity fraud. A bad actor could be impersonating Sam to attain a passport. Of course, if a bad actor were to be able to collect the required verifiable credentials—mother’s passport, birth certificate, and marriage license, that actor has already significantly compromised the system.
>   - Response: Identity assurance based on the presentation and other data, above and beyond what is in the presentation and the claims.
>   - Response: Identity assurance based on the contents of the claims, potentially with enhanced data embedded in the claims, i.e., data not currently in passports, birth certificates, or marriage license. For example, a biometric template could be embedded in the birth certificate claim and that template could be used for interactive identity assurance at the time of submitting the presentation.
> - Threat: Exposure of private information. By storing potentially compromising information in credentials and sending them over the network, we are increasing the attack surface for the subjects of those credentials.
>   - Response: Encrypt the claims (once by issuer, every verifier gets the same encrypted blob)
>   - Response: Encrypt the claims uniquely for each verifier. This may leak usage data to the issuer, assuming the holder must ask for a new, encrypted credential for each verifier.
>   - Response: Blind the claims uniquely for each verifier.
>   - Response: Encrypt the presentation uniquely for each verifier. No issuer involved.

## What do we need Proving to allow access?

## Access to own records

## Access to anther's records

We need proved:

- The targets identity
- The accessors identity
- The relationship
- That there are no "Restrictions" in places

### What relationships are there?

- Parent to Child
- Power of Attorney
  
### What are restrictions?

- Court Orders
- GP Objections?

### Identifiers

- NHS - NHS Numbers

## Verifiable Credentials for Children - No Digital Wallet

A child (the subject) needs a digital verfiable credential. But without a digital wallet, it needs to be held by someone else (the holder).

<https://sphereon.com/verifiable-credentials-example/>

Anand is still a toddler and does not have his own digital wallet to hold his Verifiable Credentials. That is not a problem in the W3C Digital Identities system, as it accommodates the concept of Guardianship for minors or incapacitated individuals.

### dId's

A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a DID, associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a verifiable credential and are associated with subjects such that a verifiable credential itself can be easily ported from one repository to another without the need to reissue the credential. An example of a DID is did:example:123456abcdef.
